# Stock_Market_Clustering-K_Means-
   The stock market is a complex and dynamic system that can be challenging to understand and predict. Stock market clustering using k-means is a project aimed at understanding the stock market and identifying patterns in stock price movements. This project aims to cluster stocks based on their daily price movements using the k-means clustering algorithm.

# K-Means Clustering
   K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach that can solve clustering issues in data science or machine learning. <br />
   By grouping the set of data points into a number of groups, clustering aims to make the data points within each group more comparable and distinct from the data points within the other groups. It is a grouping of things based on how similar and different they are. <br />
   K-Means Clustering divides the unlabeled dataset into various clusters. If K is set to 2, there will be two clusters generated during the procedure. If K is set to 3, there will be three clusters created during the process, and so on. <br />
   Stock market clustering using k-means is a useful technique for understanding the stock market and identifying patterns in stock price movements. The project successfully clustered stocks into groups based on their daily price movements using the k-means algorithm. Investors can use the project results to make informed decisions when investing in the stock market.
